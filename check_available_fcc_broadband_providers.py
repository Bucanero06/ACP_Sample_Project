Checking the availability of service providers in MetConnect currently takes the form of two options:
    1. FIND OUT WHAT PROVIDERS ARE AVAILABLE IN YOUR CUSTOMERS ZIP CODE USING BROADBAND NOW
        a. Is not always accurate and can be misleading. Only works based on zipcode so further verification of
            providers tends to be a most.
    2. FIND OUT WHAT PROVIDERS ARE AVAILABLE USING THE FCC BROADBAND MAP
        a. mapping platform has become dated, as has the coverage data, which was collected through the National
        Telecommunications and Information Administrationâ€™s (NTIA) State Broadband Initiative (SBI); the last published
        SBI data set was current as of June 30, 2014.  Based on the age of the data, and the underlying technology, the
        National Broadband Map and its Application Program Interface (API), will be decommissioned on December 21, 2018.

To follow this protocol as close as possible this is a sample solution until the nessesary hoops are jumped through
    with the FCC and USAC.
